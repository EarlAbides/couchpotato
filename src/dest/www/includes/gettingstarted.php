<p><?php echo $appname; ?> does not download actual movies, it only downloads .torrent/.nzb files. In order to automate your downloads you need to also configure <?php echo $appname; ?> to communicate with a download program, like SABnzbd, NZBGet or Transmission. A good guide to configure this integration between <?php echo $appname; ?> and NZBGet, for example, can be found <a href="http://www.htpcguides.com/configure-couchpotato-usenet-torrents/" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to password-protect <?php echo $appname; ?> if it is going to be exposed to the internet. This can be done in the &quot;General&quot; settings page.</p>
